# Individual-Project-Data-Science-Foundations-
This project investigates how offensive and defensive performance metrics contribute to a Major League Baseball (MLB) team’s winning percentage, with the goal of identifying which statistics are most predictive of success. By analyzing historical and modern team statistics, this project seeks to uncover the relative influence of batting, pitching, and fielding measures on overall team performance. All datasets, graphs and code snippets, and full code are included in the corresponding folders:
- Graph folder: contains all pictures used in the report
- Code folder: contains the Jupyter notebook coding file
- Data folder: contains the dataset used in the analysis
- Report folder: contains docx and pdf version of my final project report
