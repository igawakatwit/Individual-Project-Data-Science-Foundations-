# Individual-Project-Data-Science-Foundations-
This project investigates how offensive and defensive performance metrics contribute to a Major League Baseball (MLB) team’s winning percentage, with the goal of identifying which statistics are most predictive of success. Baseball has long been a sport defined by numbers, and the rise of sabermetrics has only deepened the importance of data-driven decision making. By analyzing historical and modern team statistics, this project seeks to uncover the relative influence of batting, pitching, and fielding measures on overall team performance.
